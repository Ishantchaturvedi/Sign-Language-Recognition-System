Sign Language recognition System

Sign language is the only tool of communication for the person who is not able to
speak and hear anything. Sign language is a boon for the physically challenged people
to express their thoughts and emotion. In this work, a novel scheme of sign language
recognition has been proposed for identifying the alphabets and gestures in sign
language. With the help of computer vision and neural networks we can detect the
signs and give the respective text output.
